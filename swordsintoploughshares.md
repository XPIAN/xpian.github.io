# Did Jesus Establish The Peaceful Kingdom Prophesied in the Old Testament?

One of the most remarkable aspects of the Old Testament is the many
prophecies it contains which have been clearly fulfilled. Some of the
fulfilled Old Testament prophecies are so detailed that some secular
scholars want to date those prophecies after their fulfillment because
they do not believe it is possible to predict future events with such
accuracy. However, one class of Old Testament prophecies that this can
not be done for are the many prophecies that clearly refer to Jesus and
his first coming. Clearly the Jewish prophetic writings in the Old
Testament were not written after the coming of Jesus. The historical and
archaeological evidence against such a possibility is just too
significant. As well, what motivation would Jewish religious leaders
have to accept new prophetic writings in the first century or later
which clearly supported the Christian claim that Jesus was the Jewish
Messiah? This makes the many prophecies that Jesus fulfilled in his life
one of the strongest lines of evidence to support the reliability of the
Old Testament.

If you wanted to demonstrate to someone the reliability of the Old
Testament by giving examples of Old Testament prophecies that had been
fulfilled, which ones would you be most likely to use? Obviously you
would want to to choose the prophecies which had most clearly been
fulfilled, especially if you were trying to convince a skeptic.
Prophecies that had only been fulfilled in a figurative way would not be
good candidates to convince skeptics.

For the early Christians from the mid-second century to the mid-fourth
century, a prophecy that is repeatedly used in their writings as an
example of fulfilled prophecy is one contained both in Isaiah 2 and
Micah 4.

This prophecy, as recorded in Isaiah 2, is this:

> The word that came from the Lord to Esaias son of Amos concerning
> Judea and concerning Ierousalem. For in the last days the mountain of
> the Lord shall be manifest, and the house of God shall be on the tops
> of the mountains and shall be raised above the hills, and all the
> nations shall come to it. And many nations shall go and say, "Come,
> let us go up to the mountain of the Lord and to the house of the God
> of Iakob, and he will declare to us his way, and we will walk in it."
> For out of Sion shall go forth a law, and a word of the Lord from
> Ierousalem. And he shall judge between the nations and shall convict
> many people, and they shall beat their daggers into plows and their
> spears into pruning hooks, and no more shall nation take up dagger
> against nation, neither shall they learn to wage war any more.[^1]
> (NETS)

The same prophecy, worded almost exactly the same but with some
additional details, occurs in Micah 4:

> And it shall be in the last days, the mountain of the Lord shall be
> manifest, prepared on the tops of the mountains, and it shall be
> elevated beyond the hills. And peoples shall hasten to it, and many
> nations shall come and say: "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the
> Lord and to the house of the God of Iakob, and they will show us his
> way, and we will walk in his paths." Because out of Sion shall go forth
> a law, and a word of the Lord from Ierousalem. And he shall judge
> between many peoples and shall reprove strong nations far away, and they
> shall cut their swords into plows and their spears into sickles, and
> nation shall no longer lift up sword against nation, and they shall
> learn war no more, and each one shall rest under his vine, and each
> under his fig tree, and no one shall make them afraid, for the mouth of
> the Lord Almighty has spoken this.

> Because all the peoples will walk, each in its own way, but we will walk
> in the name of the Lord, our God, forever and anon.

> In that day, says the Lord, I will assemble her who is shattered, and
> I will welcome her who is rejected and those whom I drove away. And I
> will make her who is shattered a remnant, and her who is driven away a
> strong nation, and the Lord will reign over them in Mount Sion from
> now and forever. (NETS)

The early Christian writings that we still have quote this prophecy for
two main reasons. The first is to convince non-Christians of the
reliability of the Old Testament writings. The second is to demonstrate
that the old law given through Moses had been replaced by a new law
given by Jesus which was part of the new covenant that had long been
prophesied and was open to people of all nations.

In the surviving Christian writings from the first three centuries of
Christianity, this prophecy is referenced as fulfilled prophecy a total
of eight times by five different writers. This may not seem like that
many. However, given how little has survived of all that must have been
written by Christians from that time period, how diverse the surviving
writings are[^2] and how many fulfilled prophecies there are in the Old
Testament, this is significant evidence of the importance the early
Christians in general must have attached to this prophecy. As further
evidence of this, Origen wrote in a letter to Africanus, a fellow
Christian, "who of all believers does not know the words in Esaias?" and
then quotes this prophecy from Isaiah 2[^3]. Even as a very loose
generalization, such a rhetorical question as Origen made could not be
made honestly by almost any group or denomination claiming to be
Christian today. Most groups and denominations today view this prophecy
as something that will only be fulfilled at some point in the future and
so it is not surprising that the importance they attach to it is not
such that they could claim that essentially everyone in their group knew
the words of this prophecy.

The diversity of who this prophecy is quoted for is interesting evidence
of how clear the fulfillment of this prophecy must have been in the
first few centuries of Christianity. It is mentioned in a defense of
Christianity written to the Roman Emperor and Roman Senate, twice to, or
in response to, skeptical Jews, three times in response to a Gnostic
leader, and once in response to the criticism of a pagan philosopher.

What follows are most of the references to this prophecy from the early
Christian writings. For the sake of space, I have not reproduced one of
the times that Tertullian quotes this prophecy because he uses it twice
in the same writing[^4]. The other references to this prophecy that I
have not included do not clearly indicate anything about the timing of
the fulfillment of this prophecy[^5]. There are no references in the
writings of the early Christians to this prophecy only being fulfilled
in the future[^6]. Some of these quotes are probably longer than is
necessary to understand the main point that I am quoting them for.
However, I have seen many short quotes from the early Christian writings
which have been either dishonestly or carelessly quoted in a way that
gives a very different impression than fuller context does. I am trying
to avoid even the suspicion of this by quoting abundant context. In
addition I have referenced all of the quotes (in multiple translations,
if possible) so that those who doubt my conclusion can examine the
evidence for themselves.

The first excerpt is from Justin's (often referred to as Justin Martyr)
*First Apology*, a written defense of Christianity which Justin
addressed to the Roman emperor, Antoninus Pius and to the Roman Senate.
This apology was written in the mid-second century. This excerpt occurs
in a section of the apology where Justin is quoting fulfilled Old
Testament prophecies to show his readers that Jesus really was the Son
of God:

> But when the Prophetic Spirit speaks, as foretelling what is going to
> happen, His words are the following: 'For the law shall come forth
> from Sion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And He shall judge
> the Gentiles, and rebuke many people; and they shall turn their swords
> into ploughshares, and their spears into sickles; nation shall not
> lift up sword against nation, neither shall they be exercised any more
> in war.' That this prophecy, too, was verified you can readily
> believe, for twelve illiterate men, unskilled in the art of speaking,
> went out from Jerusalem into the world, and by the power of God they
> announced to the men of every nation that they were sent by Christ to
> teach everyone the word of God; and we, who once killed one another,
> \[now\] not only do not wage war against our enemies, but, in order to
> avoid lying or deceiving our examiners, we even meet death cheerfully,
> confessing Christ. In this case we might well follow that saying: 'The
> tongue has sworn, but the mind is unsworn.'[^7] But, if the soldiers
> enrolled and sworn in by you prefer the allegiance they owe to you
> rather than their own life, their parents, their country, and all
> their relatives, though you cannot offer them anything immortal as
> reward, it would be ridiculous if we who long for immortality should
> not bear all things patiently, in order to attain what we hope for
> from Him who has the power to grant it.[^8]

The next excerpt is from Justin's *Dialogue With Trypho* which records a
long conversation that Justin had with Trypho, a Jew. In this dialogue,
Justin uses primarily the Old Testament writings to try to convince
Trypho that Jesus is the anointed one of God. This dialogue was written
some time after Justin's F*irst Apology* and some time before his
execution by the Roman government in the 160s.

> "But that the Gentiles would repent of the evil in which they led
> erring lives, when they heard the doctrine preached by His apostles
> from Jerusalem, and which they learned through them, suffer me to show
> you by quoting a short statement from the prophecy of Micah, one of
> the twelve \[minor prophets\]. This is as follows: 'And in the last
> days the mountain of the Lord shall be manifest, established on the
> top of the mountains; it shall be exalted above the hills, and people
> shall flow unto it. And many nations shall go, and say, Come, let us
> go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of
> Jacob; and they shall enlighten us in His way, and we shall walk in
> His paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the
> Lord from Jerusalem. And He shall judge among many peoples, and shall
> rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into
> ploughshares, and their spears into sickles: nation shall not lift up
> a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. And
> each man shall sit under his vine and under his fig tree; and there
> shall be none to terrify: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath
> spoken it. For all people will walk in the name of their gods; but we
> will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever. And it shall come
> to pass in that day, that I will assemble her that is afflicted, and
> gather her that is driven out, and whom I had plagued; and I shall
> make her that is afflicted a remnant, and her that is oppressed a
> strong nation. And the Lord shall reign over them in Mount Zion from
> henceforth, and even for ever.'"

> And when I had finished these words, I continued: "Now I am aware that
> your teachers, sirs, admit the whole of the words of this passage to
> refer to Christ; and I am likewise aware that they maintain He has not
> yet come; or if they say that He has come, they assert that it is not
> known who He is; but when He shall become manifest and glorious, then it
> shall be known who He is. And then, they say, the events mentioned in
> this passage shall happen, just as if there was no fruit as yet from the
> words of the prophecy. O unreasoning men! understanding not what has
> been proved by all these passages, that two advents of Christ have been
> announced: the one, in which He is set forth as suffering, inglorious,
> dishonoured, and crucified; but the other, in which He shall come from
> heaven with glory, when the man of apostasy, who speaks strange things
> against the Most High, shall venture to do unlawful deeds on the earth
> against us the Christians, who, having learned the true worship of God
> from the law, and the word which went forth from Jerusalem by means of
> the apostles of Jesus, have fled for safety to the God of Jacob and God
> of Israel; and we who were filled with war, and mutual slaughter, and
> every wickedness, have each through the whole earth changed our warlike
> weapons,--- our swords into ploughshares, and our spears into implements
> of tillage, ---and we cultivate piety, righteousness, philanthropy,
> faith, and hope, which we have from the Father Himself through Him who
> was crucified; and sitting each under his vine, i.e., each man
> possessing his own married wife. For you are aware that the prophetic
> word says, 'And his wife shall be like a fruitful vine.' Now it is
> evident that no one can terrify or subdue us who have believed in Jesus
> over all the world. For it is plain that, though beheaded, and

> again, and yields other branches flourishing and fruitful; even so the

> Saviour is His people. But the rest of the prophecy shall be fulfilled
> at His second coming. For the expression, 'He that is afflicted \[and
> driven out\],' i.e., from the world, \[implies\] that, so far as you and
> all other men have it in your power, each Christian has been driven out
> not only from his own property, but even from the whole world; for you
> permit no Christian to live. But you say that the same fate has befallen
> your own nation. Now, if you have been cast out after defeat in battle,
> you have suffered such treatment justly indeed, as all the Scriptures
> bear witness; but we, though we have done no such \[evil acts\][^9]
> after we knew the truth of God, are testified to by God, that, together
> with the most righteous, and only spotless and sinless Christ, we are
> taken away out of the earth. For Isaiah cries, 'Behold how the righteous
> perishes, and no man lays it to heart; and righteous men are taken away,
> and no man considers it.'[^10]

The next excerpt is from Irenaeus's five-volume *On the Detection and
Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis*, which is usually called *Against
Heresies*. Irenaeus was an overseer in Lyons and wrote in the
middle-to-late second century. This writing is a detailed description of
the beliefs of all the Gnostic[^11] sects that Irenaeus knew of, along
with detailed arguments against their beliefs. This excerpt deals with a
common Gnostic belief that the god of the Old Testament was a defective
god (or even an evil god) and not the same god as Jesus's father. Many
of the Gnostics, including Marcion, rejected the Old Testament as a
product of this defective god. Marcion therefore rejected the Old
Testament prophets. This excerpt is in a section of Irenaeus's writing
where he is demonstrating that Jesus brought something new, as
prophesied by the Old Testament prophets.

> 1\. Now I shall simply say, in opposition to all the heretics, and
> principally against the followers of Marcion, and against those who are
> like to these, in maintaining that the prophets were from another God
> \[than He who is announced in the Gospel\], read with earnest care that
> Gospel which has been conveyed to us by the apostles, and read with
> earnest care the prophets, and you will find that the whole conduct, and
> all the doctrine, and all the sufferings of our Lord, were predicted
> through them. But if a thought of this kind should then suggest itself
> to you, to say, What then did the Lord bring to us by His advent?---know
> ye that He brought all \[possible\] newness, by bringing Himself who had
> been announced. For this very thing was proclaimed beforehand, that a
> newness should come to renew and make alive mankind. For the advent of
> the King is previously announced by those servants who are sent \[before
> Him\], in order to prepare and equip those men who are to receive their
> Lord. But when the King has actually come, and those who are His
> subjects have been filled with that joy which was proclaimed beforehand,
> and have attained to that liberty which He bestows, and share in the
> sight of Him, and have listened to His words, and have enjoyed the gifts
> which He confers, the question will not then be asked by any that are
> possessed of sense what new thing the King has brought beyond \[that
> proclaimed by\] those who announced His coming. For He has brought
> Himself, and has bestowed on men those good things which were announced
> beforehand, which things the angels desired to look into.

> 2\. But the servants would then have been proved false, and not sent by
> the Lord, if Christ on His advent, by being found exactly such as He was
> previously announced, had not fulfilled their words. Wherefore He said,
> "Think not that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets; I came
> not to destroy, but to fulfil. For truly I say unto you, Until heaven
> and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall not pass from the law
> and the prophets till all come to pass." For by His advent He Himself
> fulfilled all things, and does still fulfil in the Church the new
> covenant foretold by the law, onwards to the consummation \[of all
> things\]. To this effect also Paul, His apostle, says in the Epistle to
> the Romans, "But now, without the law, has the righteousness of God been
> manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; for the just
> shall live by faith." But this fact, that the just shall live by faith,
> had been previously announced by the prophets.

> 3\. But whence could the prophets have had power to predict the advent of
> the King, and to preach beforehand that liberty which was bestowed by
> Him, and previously to announce all things which were done by Christ,
> His words, His works, and His sufferings, and to predict the new
> covenant, if they had received prophetical inspiration from another God
> \[than He who is revealed in the Gospel\], they being ignorant, as ye
> allege, of the indescribable Father, of His kingdom, and His
> dispensations, which the Son of God fulfilled when He came upon earth in

> came to pass by a certain kind of chance, as if they were spoken by the
> prophets in regard to some other person, while similar events happened

> \[prophets\] who lived subsequently would certainly not have prophesied
> that these events should come to pass in the last times. Moreover, there
> is in fact none among the fathers, nor the prophets, nor the ancient
> kings, in whose case any one of these things properly and specifically
> took place. For all indeed prophesied as to the sufferings of Christ,
> but they themselves were far from enduring sufferings similar to what
> was predicted. And the points connected with the passion of the Lord,

> nations believe in the name of any other; nor did any from among them,
> having been dead and rising again, lay open the new covenant of liberty.
> Therefore the prophets spoke not of any one else but of the Lord, in
> whom all these aforesaid tokens concurred.

> and no man considers it; and righteous men are taken away, and no man

The next writing is part of Tertullian's *Against the Jews*, which gives
Tertullian's response to a debate he witnessed between a Christian and a
Jewish proselyte. Tertullian is writing to show that the Christians are
the New Covenant replacement for physical Israel under the Old Covenant.
He also shows that this was prophesied by the Old Testament prophets.
This excerpt is from a part of *Against the Jews* that is dealing with
the replacement of physical circumcision with circumcision of the heart,
and more broadly the replacement of the old law with the new law[^13].
Tertuallian was a Christian from the Roman city of Carthage in North
Africa and wrote around the beginning of the third century.

> 3.4 In fact, just as circumcision of the flesh, which was temporary, was
> initiated as a sign for a stubborn people, so one of the spirit was
> given as salvation for an obedient people, as Jeremiah says, 'Renew
> yourselves and do not plant among thorns. Be circumcised for God and
> circumcise the foreskin of your heart.' And in another place it says,
> 'For behold, the days are coming,' says the Lord, 'and I will draw up a
> new covenant for the house of Judah and the house of Jacob. It shall not
> be such as I gave to their ancestors on the day I led them from the land
> of Egypt'. 3.8 From this we understand that it was announced both that
> the first circumcision would cease and that the new law, not like the
> one \[God\] had given already to the ancestors, would appear. This was
> just as Isaiah proclaimed when he said that, in the last days, the
> mountain of the Lord would be made visible, as well as the house of God
> upon the summits of the mountains. 'It shall be raised,' he says, 'on
> the hills and all clans shall come to it and many shall walk and say,
> "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord and to the house of the
> God of Jacob."' He did not say 'of Esau', the first son, but 'of Jacob',
> the following---that is, of our people---whose mountain is the Christ
> who has been shown according to Daniel as having been carved without the
> hands of the carvers and filling all the earth. 3.9 Further, Isaiah
> announced that the new law would appear from this house of the God of
> Jacob, when he said in the following words, 'For a law shall go forth
> from Sion and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem and it shall judge
> between the clans'---that is, between us who have been called from the
> Gentiles---and he says, 'they shall refashion their swords into ploughs
> and their spears into sickles and one clan shall not take the sword
> against another and henceforth they shall not learn to fight.' 3.10
> Therefore, who is understood other than us, who, having been instructed
> in the new law, observe it, since the old law has been cancelled, whose
> future abolition he was demonstrating beforehand, by that very act? For
> the old law used to protect itself by the vengeance of the sword and
> used to tear out eye for eye and would pay back injury with revenge.
> However, the new law was pointing out clemency and was changing the
> previous savagery of sword and lance into stillness, and was reforming
> the previous conduct of war against rivals and enemies into the peaceful
> actions of ploughing and cultivating the land.

> 3.11 Therefore, as we have shown above, just as the ceasing of the old
> law and circumcision of the flesh was declared, so too the observance
> of the new law and of circumcision of the spirit has shone forth in
> peaceful obedience. In fact, the prophets have announced 'a people
> that I have not known have been attentive to me and in the listening
> of the ear have obeyed me'.[^14]

The following excerpt is from Tertullian's work *Against Marcion*. This
is the same Marcion who Irenaeus wrote against in the quote above from
*Against Heresies*. This excerpt is concerned with a belief, which
Marcion apparently taught, that there were two Christs, one from the
creator of this world (who Marcion believed was a corrupted, inferior
god) and one from the supreme God.

> Neither for that matter can you establish that suggestion of yours,
> with a view to distinguishing between two Christs, as that the Judaic
> Christ was intended by the Creator for the regathering out of
> dispersion of the people \<of Israel\> and no others, whereas your
> Christ has been advanced by the supremely good god for the deliverance
> of the whole human race: because, when all is said, the Creator's
> Christians are found to have existed before Marcion's, in that all
> peoples have been receiving the call into his kingdom ever since God
> has reigned from the tree, before there was any Cerdo[^15] even, let
> alone Marcion. Refuted however on the vocation of the gentiles, you
> now turn back to proselytes. You ask who they are from among the
> gentiles, that are passing over to the Creator, when those
> specifically mentioned by the prophet are proselytes, of a different
> condition, separate, by themselves: *Behold*, Isaiah says, *proselytes
> by me shall come near unto thee*, showing that even proselytes were to
> come to God through Christ. Also the gentiles, which we are, likewise
> had their own mention, as people that were hoping in Christ: *And in
> his name*, he says, *shall the gentiles hope.* Proselytes
> however, whom you interpolate into the prophecy concerning the
> gentiles, do not as a rule hope in Christ's name, but in Moses' law,
> from which their instruction comes: whereas the promotion of the
> gentiles has come about in these last days. In those very words Isaiah
> says, *And it shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of
> the Lord shall be manifest*, namely, the majesty of God, *and the
> temple of God above the top of the mountains*, meaning Christ, the
> catholic temple of God, in whom God is worshipped, established above
> all the eminences of virtues and powers: *and all the nations shall
> come to it, and many shall go and say, Come ye, let us go up into the
> mountain of the Lord, and into the house of the God of Jacob, and he
> will announce to us his way, and we will walk in it: for out of Sion
> shall go forth a law, and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem*. This
> way must be the gospel of the new law, and of the new word in Christ,
> no longer in Moses. *And he will judge among the nations*, in respect
> of their error: *and he shall confute a large people*, in the first
> instance that of the Jews and their proselytes. *And they shall break
> down their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into
> pruning-hooks*, that is, all the devices of injurious minds and
> hostile tongues and of all malice and blasphemy, they shall convert
> into the interests of moderation and peace. And *nation shall not take
> up sword against nation*, the sword of discord: *neither shall they
> learn war any more*, that is, follow up hostilities: so that here too
> you may learn that the Christ who was promised was not one powerful in
> war, but a bringer of peace. Either deny that these things were
> prophesied, now that they are plainly seen, or deny that they have
> been fulfilled, now that you have read them: or, if you avoid both
> denials, they must have been fulfilled in him of whom they were
> prophesied. Take notice even now of the inception and progress of
> \<his\> vocation to the gentiles, who since the last days are coming
> to God the Creator, that it was not \<addressed\> to proselytes, whose
> promotion \<dates\> rather from the earliest days. For this faith of
> ours was introduced by the apostles.[^16]

The following excerpt is from Origen's long defence of Christianity
written in response to criticism of the pagan philosopher, Celsus.
Origen wrote against Celsus around the middle of the third century.

Even around the time when such significant compromise was taking place
that many Christian overseers allowed themselves to become part of the
Roman Emperor Constantine's new state religion[^19], still we find
evidence of this important prophecy being applied to Christians of that
day. Athanasius of Alexandria, who was one of the most well known
compromisers who joined Constantine's state religion, said the following
in one of his writings about the incarnation of the Word of God. This
writing is generally dated to somewhere in the decade before or the
decade after the Council of Nicea, which was in A.D. 325.

> And who among men has ever been able to penetrate even to Scythians
> and Ethiopians, or Parthians or Armenians or those who are said to
> live beyond Hyrcania, or even the Egyptians and Chaldeans, people who
> give heed to magic and are more than naturally enslaved by the fear of
> demons and savage in their habits, and to preach at all about virtue
> and self-control and against the worshipping of idols, as has the Lord
> of all, the Power of God, our Lord Jesus Christ? Yet He not only
> preached through His own disciples, but also wrought so persuasively
> on men's understanding that, laying aside their savage habits and
> forsaking the worship of their ancestral gods, they learnt to know Him
> and through Him to worship the Father. While they were yet idolaters,
> the Greeks and Barbarians were always at war with each other, and were
> even cruel to their own kith and kin. Nobody could travel by land or
> sea at all unless he was armed with swords, because of their
> irreconcilable quarrels with each other. Indeed, the whole course of
> their life was carried on with the weapons, and the sword with them
> replaced the staff and was the mainstay of all aid. All this time, as
> I said before, they were serving idols and offering sacrifices to
> demons, and for all the superstitious awe that accompanied this idol
> worship, nothing could wean them from that warlike spirit. But,
> strange to relate, since they came over to the school of Christ, as
> men moved with real compunction they have laid aside their murderous
> cruelty and are war-minded no more. On the contrary, all is peace
> among them and nothing remains save desire for friendship.

> 52\. Who, then, is He Who has done these things and has united in peace
> those who hated each other, save the beloved Son of the Father, the
> common Savior of all, Jesus Christ, Who by His own love underwent all
> things for our salvation? Even from the beginning, moreover, this peace
> that He was to administer was foretold, for Scripture says, "They shall
> beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into sickles, and
> nation shall not take sword against nation, neither shall they learn any
> more to wage war." Nor is this by any means incredible.

> The barbarians of the present day are naturally savage in their
> habits, and as long as they sacrifice to their idols they rage
> furiously against each other and cannot bear to be a single hour
> without weapons. But when they hear the teaching of Christ, forthwith
> they turn from fighting to farming, and instead of arming themselves
> with swords extend their hands in prayer. In a word, instead of
> fighting each other, they take up arms against the devil and the
> demons, and overcome them by their selfcommand and integrity of soul.
> These facts are proof of the Godhead of the Savior, for He has taught

> them away and mock at their captain the devil. Even in youth they are
> chaste, they endure in times of testing and persevere in toils. When
> they are insulted, they are patient, when robbed they make light of

All of these quotes, combined with the absence in the surviving early
Christian writings of any quotes to the contrary[^21], give good
evidence that the early Christians strongly saw themselves as the
fulfillment of the prophecies in Isaiah 2 and Micah 4. The fact that
they were willing to quote this both directly to and in response to
skeptical or hostile non-Christians shows that the peaceful disposition
of the Christians must have been so universal as to be beyond question.
Justin's reference to this prophecy in his first apology make this
especially clear. Obviously the Roman Emperor and Senate would have had
reason to know if everyone was putting down their swords when they
became Christians. If some large number of people had continued being
willing to fight after converting to Christianity, Justin's arguments
would have been useless.

The argument could be made that the early Christian writings that we
have are not representative of early Christianity as a whole. That could
be the case if those who preserved these writings either altered them or
just selectively preserved those writings that they agreed with and did
not preserve ones contrary to their opinions. However, this seems highly
unlikely in relation to the prophecy of beating swords into
ploughshares. Most, if not all, of the early Christian writings we have
were preserved by members of the Roman state religion founded by
Constantine[^22]. This state religion very quickly started to accept the
idea that a Christian could wield the sword, at least for the state.
Within 100 years of the founding of this state religion, prominent
leaders in this institution, like Ambrose of Milan and Augustine of
Hippo, started to publicly teach this. Quickly, this became the norm and
Rome's army became nominally "Christian". It seems highly unlikely that
such an institution would have suppressed the writings of early
Christians that supported the idea that Christians did not have to be
universally peaceful. It seems equally unlikely that they would have
altered earlier writings to insert claims that Christians were the
fulfillment of the peaceful prophecies of Isaiah 2 and Micah 4. If the
early Christian writings we have are not representative of early
Christian teaching and practice in relation to the sword, it would be
much more likely to be the result of the suppression of writings that
taught that Christians had given up the use of the sword. What we do
know is that such strong statements as are quoted above from the early
Christian writings were preserved by such a violent religion as the
Roman state religion. This is very good evidence that the universal
peacefulness of the early Christians must have been too well established
to hide or quickly explain away.

Athanasius's use of this prophecy is further confirmation of this fact.
Athanasius was writing at a time when Constantine had already showed
considerable favour to the Christians. Constantine's favour towards the
Christians came shortly after an intense period of state-sponsored
persecution. It must have been obvious to Athanasius that Constantine
was neither likely to beat his sword into a ploughshare, nor his spear
into a pruning hook. Obviously he could not have done so without giving
up his position as Emperor. It must have been tempting for Athanasius to
compromise the previous understanding of the universal peacefulness of
Christians. He eventually did and by the middle of the fourth century,
Athanasius had concluded that a Roman Emperor could be a Christian[^23].
By that time in Athanasius's life, undoubtedly his explanation of
Isaiah's prophecy would have been different than it had before.
Athanasius's previous strong statements about Christians' universal
peacefulness and willingness to suffer wrong at the hands of their
enemies seem most likely to have represented the continuation of a
strongly established tradition, which even in the face of significant
temptation must have taken some time to undo.

What then is the practical significance of all of this? After all, even
if all the Christians from the time of Justin Martyr to the time of
Athanasius's early days were unified in believing that Christians needed
to be universally peaceful, they are not ultimately the authority by
which right and wrong will be judged. However, if Jesus really taught
his first disciples that they could use the sword, it is very strange
that by the 150s, this could have been so universally forgotten that
every Christian who wrote on the topic for nearly 200 years after would
believe that Christianity was the undeniable fulfillment of the prophecy
in Isaiah 2 and Micah 4. If Jesus's recorded teaching relating to the
topic was not so consistent with the conclusions of these two centuries
of early Christian writers, it might be worth considering the
possibility that they all were in error. However, their understanding of
universal peacefulness and love is consistent with a straightforward
interpretation of everything Jesus has to say on the topic. It is also
consistent with the example of the Christians in the New Testament after
the coming of the Holy Spirit. The combination of these things makes it
ridiculous to think that Christianity as Jesus established it is
compatible with the use of the sword.

[^1]: These translations of Isaiah and Micah are from the Septuagint,
    the Greek translation of the Old Testament, which was the Old
    Testament used by the early Christians. This translation, *The New
    English Translation of the Septuagint*, retains the Greek spelling
    of some of the names.

[^2]: Much of the writing that has survived from that era does not
    directly relate to fulfilled prophecy.

[^3]: Origen quotes this prophecy in his letter to Africanus as an
    example of where the prophets repeat each other.

[^4]: The quote that I left out is from Tertullian's *Against Marcion*
    (also known by it's Latin name, *Adversus Marcionem*) book IV,
    chapter I. This can be found in *The Ante-Nicene Fathers*, volume 3,
    pages 345-346 and *Tertullian: Adversus Marcionem* translated by
    Ernest Evans, pages 257 & 259 (even numbered pages contain the Latin
    text). Tertuallian also makes an allusion to this prophecy, without
    actually quoting it, in his writing entitled *Scorpiace*, chapter
    XIII, which can be found in *The Ante-Nicene Fathers*, volume 3,
    page 646. In *Scorpiace* Tertullian refers to Paul's conversation as
    exchanging a dagger for a plough.

[^5]: Cyprian in *Three Books of Testimonies Against the Jews*, book II,
    chapter 18 seems to imply this prophesy is fulfilled but he is not
    explicit about this. John Chrysostom in his *Homily XIX* (on Matthew
    6) quotes this prophecy but is not explicit about its fulfillment.

[^6]: Eusebius of Caesarea, also known as Eusebius Pamphilus, was a
    close associate of the Roman Emperor Constantine. His worship of
    Constantine is clear evidence of his departure from the way of
    Christ. In his *Oration in Praise of Constantine*, which he wrote to
    commemorate the thirtieth year of Constantine's reign, Eusebius uses
    this prophecy about beating swords into ploughshares and claims it
    is fulfilled by the extension of the Roman empire over the whole
    earth, thereby ending wars between nations. This is obvious
    politically motivated flattery and has no clear connection to
    reality. Even if the very limited application of this prophecy that
    Eusebius gives could be accepted (ignoring the fact that Constantine
    was the commander of the largest army in the Western world at the
    time), Constantine's career was marked by war, both external war
    with foreign nations and civil war with rival emperors. See
    Eusebius, *In Praise of Constantine*, chapter XVI, found in *Nicene
    and Post-Nicene Fathers*, second series, volume 1, pages 606-607.

[^7]: In other words, they could have sworn to Caesar, but not really
    meant it, just to avoid persecution.

[^9]: This is probably a reference to the fact that the Jewish people
    took up weapons against the Romans in several Jewish-Roman wars that
    resulted in the destruction of Jerusalem and Herod's Temple, the
    banning of Jews from Jerusalem, the death of more than 1.5 million
    Jews and the destruction of many Jewish cities and villages. In
    contrast, the Christians did not take up arms, even at times when
    they were brutally suppressed by the Romans.

[^11]: Gnostic is from the Greek word gnosis (γνῶσις) which means

    excerpt, showing that he firmly believed that Jesus was a law-giver
    of a new law, just like Moses was of the old law.

[^17]: Origen is responding to this quote from Celsus: "Now the Jews
    became an individual nation, and made laws according to the custom
    of their country; and they maintain these laws among themselves at
    the present day, and observe a worship which may be very peculiar
    but is at least traditional. In this respect they behave like the
    rest of mankind, because each nation follows its traditional
    customs, whatever kind may happen to be established. This situation
    seems to have come to pass not only because it came into the head of
    different people to think differently and because it is necessary to
    preserve the established social conventions, but also because it is
    probable that from the beginning the different parts of the earth
    were allotted to different overseers, and are governed in this way
    by having been divided between certain authorities. In fact, the
    practices done by each nation are right when they are done in the
    way that pleases the overseers; and it is impious to abandon the
    customs which have existed in each locality from the beginning."

[^19]: Constantine did not claim to be starting a new religion. He gave
    imperial protection, privilege and significant money to those groups
    professing Christianity who were willing to accept him and the
    version of "Christainity" that he approved. His state religion
    (which was still an informal state religion until A.D. 380) allowed
    him to exercise significant authority over religious matters while
    still being an unbaptized and wicked man. His state religion was a
    synthesis of historical Christianity marred by significant previous
    compromise and the continued major compromises which are almost
    inevitable with the influence of power and money that state
    involvement and approval brought.

    English translation is found in *Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers*,
    second series, volume 4, pages 64-65.

[^21]: The reference by Eusebius referred to in footnote 6 above is the
    earliest differing opinion. However, even Eusebius claimed it was a
    fulfilled prophecy. Eusebius's use of this prophecy is so clearly
    politically motivated that it does not represent a serious challenge
    to the idea that the understanding of this prophecy was essentially
    unanimous in the centuries previous to Eusebius.

[^22]: Constantine's approved brand of "Christianity" was only
    unofficially the state religion (with various theological swings and
    a short lapse from 361--363, under Constantine's successors) until
    A.D. 380 when it was made the official religion by law. However,
    even under Constantine this unofficial state religion would have
    struggled to have such ongoing protection and material benefits
    without somewhat compromising Jesus's teachings to not interfere too
    much with Constantine's political agenda. Shortly after the Council
    of Nicea, Constantine is reported to have had his oldest son and
    second wife killed. Clearly any religion that would have his
    approval would have needed to have been cautious in how much it
    challenged his agenda and power as head of the Roman state and
    military.

[^23]: In a written defense that Athanasius wrote to the Roman Emperor
    Constantius II (son of Constantine) some time in the 350s, he wrote
    to Constantius II, who was still unbaptized, "that you have been a
    Christian for many years." See Athanasius's *Defence Before
    Constantius*, chapter 1 found in *Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers*,
    second series, volume 4, page 238.
