# What Jesus taught about divorce and remarriage

Published: 2025-02-17

## Some introductory comments:

This article is written to help people understand and put into practice
Jesus's teaching on marriage, divorce and remarriage. If you are not yet
ready to obey Jesus, no matter what he asks and how much it costs you,
then this article may not be helpful for you. If you are ready to follow
Jesus wherever he wants to lead you then hopefully this article can help
you to appreciate and take seriously, Jesus's beautiful and costly
teaching on marriage.

Before getting into discussing what Jesus taught, a few points of
clarification are needed to help in understanding the English
translations we are going to read: 1. Greek (like Hebrew) has no word
for wife or husband. Instead the word woman or man are used and one
needs to figure out from context if this is speaking of a wife or
husband specifically. 2. the Greek word translated divorce in these
passages (other than when referring to the certificate of divorce) is a
general word that means to let go or send away. This can include divorce
in the sense that we use that word in modern English but it can include
separation without divorce as well.

## The general rule and explanation:

> He arose from there and came into the borders of Judea and beyond the
> Jordan. Multitudes came together to him again. As he usually did, he
> was again teaching them. Pharisees came to him testing him, and asked
> him, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?" He answered, "What
> did Moses command you?" They said, "Moses allowed a certificate of
> divorce to be written, and to divorce her." But Jesus said to them,
> "For your hardness of heart, he wrote you this commandment. But from
> the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female. For this
> cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will join to his
> wife, and the two will become one flesh, so that they are no longer
> two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let no man
> separate." In the house, his disciples asked him again about the same
> matter. He said to them, "Whoever divorces his wife and marries
> another commits adultery against her. If a woman herself divorces her
> husband and marries another, she commits adultery." (Mark 10:1-12)

This passage summarizes Jesus's teaching on divorce and remarriage.
Although startling to many, its meaning is plain. The Greek manuscripts
behind this passage have some variation but none that significantly
alter the meaning of the passage. Therefore what Mark originally
intended to communicate need not be in question. In spite of these
facts, this passage is often ignored or even reviled by those who claim
to be Christian for no other reason than that a significant percentage
of people today who claim to be Christian are unwilling to accept that
remarriage following separation/divorce from one's spouse is always
adultery.

Before moving on to the other passages that record Jesus's teaching on
divorce and remarriage, consider that what we have just read is
everything that Mark chose to record of Jesus's teaching on the topic
and he clearly wrote his account as a stand-alone account, not as an
addendum to another book. Other books may add extra details but if any
of them give us a fundamentally different understanding of Jesus's
teaching on the topic, then Mark's trustworthiness would have to be
called into question. In other words, if we can not give Mark's account
that we just read above to someone who wants to understand and apply
Jesus's teaching on divorce and remarriage, without fundamentally
misleading a large number of people, then we must consider Mark either
dishonest or incapable of recording such important material as the
teaching of Jesus.

## A brief summary of the general teaching:

Luke records only one verse about divorce and remarriage:

> "Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery.
> He who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery."
> (Luke 16:18)

In Luke 16 this verse is sandwiched between Jesus's rebuke of the
Pharisees for being lovers of money and Jesus's story of a poor man
named Lazarus and the rich man who justly suffers in Hades for failing
to share his wealth with Lazarus. It is probably not a coincidence that
many people today who don't like Jesus's absolute stance on the
permanence of marriage also don't like what he taught about wealth and
possessions either, just like the wealthy Pharisees of Jesus's day.

Although Luke doesn't record the same context to Jesus's statements that
Mark's account has, the plain meaning of what he does record is clear
and in harmony with what Mark recorded: all divorce and remarriage is
adultery. Luke includes a detail that is only implied in Mark's account:
a man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery too. Like Mark, Luke
is clearly recording what he intends to be a stand-alone account of
Jesus's life and teaching. In fact, Luke even mentions the specific
person (Theophilus) that he is writing his account for. It should not be
forgotten that Luke clearly intended Theophilus to read the verse we
just read and essentially understand what Jesus taught on the topic.

## The new law in the Sermon on the Mount:

Matthew recorded two passages that directly record Jesus's teaching on
divorce and remarriage. The first is from the Sermon on the Mount and
specifically in a section where Jesus is quoting what people heard
before (usually from the law of Moses) and then giving his own either
stronger or contradictory teaching.

> "It was also said, 'Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her
> a writing of divorce,' but I tell you that whoever puts away his wife,
> except for the cause of sexual immorality, makes her an adulteress;
> and whoever marries her when she is put away commits adultery.
> (Matthew 5:31-32)

This passage is slightly less straight-forward than the ones we just
looked at in Mark and Luke but if anything is even stronger. Here Jesus
is saying not that a husband commits adultery if he puts away his wife
and marries again. Rather he is saying that a husband who puts away his
wife causes her to commit adultery (other than the case of sexual
immorality). There are a couple of things that are not as clear as they
could be in this passage. How does the husband cause his wife to commit
adultery? Presumably it is when she remarries or lives with another man
without remarriage. If it wasn't one of those cases, it isn't clear how
anything the wife could do could be adultery, since adultery is a sexual
sin against a marriage that must necessarily involve someone outside the
marriage. In other words a husband can't commit adultery with his
legitimate wife. Neither can two single people commit adultery with each
other. In a society where women were not easily able to be financially
independent, it is easy to see why a husband sending his wife away would
be putting her in a situation where she might have to choose between
adultery and starving. Whatever the reason she would be considered an
adulteress, it seems God is considering the man who puts her away at
fault for this.

The second thing in this passage that is not as clear as it could be is
what "sexually immorality" is referring to. Is it referring to an act of
adultery that the wife committed or is it referring to the nature of the
relationship being sexually immoral? In other words, is it clarifying
that a man who puts his wife away for adultery is not the cause of her
becoming an adulteress (as she already was one) or is it clarifying that
a man is only responsible for making a woman an adulteress if he puts
her away from a legitimate marriage and not from a sexually immoral
relationship? It isn't clear which is intended but either way there is
nothing in this sentence to imply that remarriage is every allowed. In
fact, the obvious implication of this sentence is that an innocent woman
put away from her husband is not permitted to remarry as she becomes an
adulteress if she does. If would be quite strange if an innocent wife
abandoned by her husband was considered an adulteress if she remarried
but an adulteress wife was allowed to remarry. However, in case there
was any ambiguity about the absoluteness of this teaching, the next
sentence from Matthew 5:32 adds clarity: "anyone who marries a divorced
woman commits adultery." Consider for a moment why that is the case. Why
is it always the case that a man who marries a women put away from her
husband is committing adultery? It is because she already has a husband.
The fact that her husband put her away, regardless of what legal process
he may have gone through, does not change the fact they he is her
husband and therefore it is adultery for her to be with any other man.

## Doesn't Matthew 19:9 teach that there is an exception to the general rule?

Before looking at the text of Matthew 19, we need to consider an
extremely important but sadly little known fact. The text of Matthew
19:9 has very significant textual variants in the surviving Greek
manuscripts of Matthew. There are many preserved Greek manuscripts of
the New Testament spanning well over a thousand years of history. They
often have small variations between each other. Some of these represent
simple copying mistakes made by scribes. Some of them seem to be
intentional attempts to harmonize one text with a parallel passage. Some
times they may have even represented a change introduced by the scribe
to support his bias. Textual critics put significant effort into trying
to figure out which of various preserved readings is the original.
Sometimes this is simple, as a variant may only be preserved in one or
two later manuscripts and therefore can probably be safely rejected.
Other times it is much harder. This is one of those harder cases.
Textual critics disagree on how to try to resolve these differences.
Some experts generally prefer older texts, assuming that the closer they
are in time to the originals, the less likely they will have been
altered. Some experts generally prefer to follow what the majority of
preserved texts read. In many cases their choices are much more complex
than that, relying on their best guess as to how an error might have
been introduced in the process of copying the text.

Stated briefly, here is a summary of the significant facts. In what is
thought to be the oldest surviving nearly complete New Testament
manuscript[^1], Matthew 19:9 reads like Matthew 5:32. What is probably
the oldest surviving fragment of Matthew 19:9[^2] also appears to have
read like Matthew 5:32[^3]. As well, almost all of the surviving early
Christian references to Matthew 19:9 read like Matthew 5:32. Very
significantly, this includes Origen's commentary on Matthew which was
written in the third century, possibly earlier than even the earliest
surviving fragment of Matthew 19:9. If that was all the relevant facts,
then determining the original reading of Matthew 19:9 would be simple.
However, to make things more complex, the manuscript that is thought to
be the second oldest surviving New Testament[^4] has Matthew 19:9
reading like this: "But I say to you: Whoever puts away his woman not
for sexual immorality and marries another commits adultery." The
majority of surviving manuscripts of Matthew 19:9 are a combination of
those two readings. This confusion has led the editors of various Greek
critical texts to varying conclusions. Erasmus, who created the first
modern Greek critical text, only had access to a few Greek texts of
Matthew and so not surprisingly, his critical text reads like the
majority with the exception of a small variant that he introduced which
will be discussed in the next section. The Westcott & Hort critical text
became the basis for the most commonly used modern critical text of the
New Testament, the Nestle--Aland/United Bible Societies Greek New
Testament. This critical text tradition has Matthew 19:9 reading like
the second oldest New Testament manuscript mentioned above. The Society
for Bible Literature's Greek New Testament and the Majority Greek New
Testament critical texts have Matthew 19:9 reading like the majority of
the surviving Greek New Testament manuscripts and read like this:
"Whoever puts away his woman not for sexual immorality and marries
another commits adultery and whoever marries a put away woman commits
adultery."

If all of that detail seems confusing, the summary is that the original
reading of Matthew 19:9 is far from certain and a very good case can be
made that Matthew 19:9 originally read exactly like Matthew 5:32. This
is significant as the popular interpretation of Matthew 19:9, that says
that someone can remarry if their spouse commits adultery, depends on an
interpretation of a very uncertain text.

## Erasmus's little addition

Erasmus, a Roman Catholic scholar who lived in the late fifteenth and
early sixteenth centuries, created the first modern Greek critical text.
As mentioned above, his text mostly followed the majority of surviving
Greek texts for Matthew 19:9 which read, "Whoever puts away his woman
not for sexual immorality and marries another commits adultery and
whoever marries a put away woman commits adultery." However, for some
unknown reason, Erasmus inserted an extra word that is not in the main
text of any surviving Greek manuscript of Matthew. With his addition,
the text reads: "Whoever puts away his woman if not for sexual
immorality and marries another commits adultery." Following Erasmus's
Greek Critical Text, English translators starting with Tyndale
translated the two words "if not" as "except", which is a reasonable
translation of those two words. This may seem like an insignificant
change but consider the following facts. Erasmus wrote in favour of
divorce and remarriage being allowed in some cases. He had no known
manuscript evidence for the addition he made. This passage was
subsequently used to justify divorce and remarriage in the case of
adultery. What other explanation is more likely than Erasmus altering
the text to better fit his own beliefs about remarriage? All recent
Greek critical texts have not followed Erasmus's example and have left
out the "if" he inserted. However, interestingly most modern English
translations continue the established tradition of putting "except" in
Matthew 19:9, even though they are not using Erasmus's Greek Text as the
basis for their translation.

## So what does Matthew 19:9 mean?

If Matthew 19:9 originally read the same as Matthew 5:32, then its
meaning has already been discussed above.

If Matthew 19:9 originally read as the majority of surviving Greek texts
read, then there are several possible explanations of its meaning.
Before listing those possible interpretations, here is a fairly literal
rendering: Whoever puts away his woman, not for (or not based on) sexual
immorality, and marries another commits adultery and whoever marries a
put away woman commits adultery.

One possible interpretation of this passage is that if a man puts away
his innocent wife and marries another, he commits adultery but if he
puts away his wife who has been guilty of sexual immorality after
marriage (that is, adultery) then he is not committing adultery to marry
again. Although there is nothing about the grammar of this sentence to
prohibit this interpretation, it has some very serious problems.

The first, and greatest problem, is that it does not align with the
other passages that record Jesus's teaching on this topic. If it were
really true that any man whose wife committed adultery was free to
remarry (or, if that was generalized to include wives as well, any
person whose spouse committed adultery was free to remarry), then this
would not be just a minor clarification or exception to the general rule
that Jesus established. Since many and probably a majority of marriage
relationship break-downs involve adultery at some point[^5], this would
make a general rule that did not mention this exception worse than
useless. This would mean that what Mark and Luke recorded was so
misleading that it could not be used to give council in most divorce
situations without having to include this one passage from Matthew. If
that were true it would seriously undermine the reliability of Mark and
Luke as witnesses to Jesus's teaching. As well, it would mean what
Matthew recorded from the Sermon on the Mount would be misleading at
best. At least with Matthew 5, you could argue that Matthew knew people
would read the exception in Matthew 19, but why would it make sense to
leave it out of Matthew 5 if Jesus said it in the Sermon on the Mount.
If Jesus didn't mention any exception in the Sermon on the Mount, then
that would make Jesus misleading since all the people who sat there and
listened to his preaching and weren't there later when the Pharisees
came to test him would be misled into thinking there was never an
exception to the general rule that divorce and remarriage was adultery.
As well, Paul's summary of Jesus's teaching on separation and remarriage
in 1 Corinthians 7:10-11 would be misleading as it gives remaining
single and being reconciled as the only two options for wives who have
left their husbands[^6].

The second reason this interpretation of Matthew 19:9 is difficult to
reconcile with the scriptures is that it conflicts with Jesus's other
teachings on forgiveness and how we should treat people who wrong us.
For example, consider this passage from Matthew 18:

> Then Peter came and said to him, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin
> against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?" Jesus said to him,
> "I don't tell you until seven times, but, until seventy times seven.
> Therefore the Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king who wanted to
> settle accounts with his servants. When he had begun to settle, one
> was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents. But because he
> couldn't pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, with his wife, his
> children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. The servant
> therefore fell down and knelt before him, saying, 'Lord, have patience
> with me, and I will repay you all!' The lord of that servant, being
> moved with compassion, released him and forgave him the debt. "But
> that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed
> him one hundred denarii, and he grabbed him and took him by the
> throat, saying, 'Pay me what you owe!' "So his fellow servant fell
> down at his feet and begged him, saying, 'Have patience with me, and I
> will repay you!' He would not, but went and cast him into prison until
> he should pay back that which was due. So when his fellow servants saw
> what was done, they were exceedingly sorry, and came and told their
> lord all that was done. Then his lord called him in and said to him,
> 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged
> me. Shouldn't you also have had mercy on your fellow servant, even as
> I had mercy on you?' His lord was angry, and delivered him to the
> tormentors until he should pay all that was due to him. So my heavenly
> Father will also do to you, if you don't each forgive your brother
> from your hearts for his misdeeds." (Matthew 18:21-35)

It is probably not an accident that this passage immediately proceeds
the passage that we are considering from Matthew 19. This very strong
teaching and warning on forgiveness is the context into which Matthew
puts this argument with the Pharisees about divorce. Consider Peter's
original question, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and
I forgive him?" Do you think Jesus understood Peter's question to
include wives and husbands? Do you think Jesus intended his disciples to
keep forgiving over and over anyone who sinned against them but if their
spouse was unfaithful to cast them away, never to be reconciled? If you
think that, then there is something very fundamental about Jesus and his
kingdom that you don't yet understand. You will not be able to be a
faithful citizen of Jesus's kingdom until you understand and embrace
what Jesus taught about forgiveness. Understanding and living by this
teaching on forgiveness is very important as Jesus summed up the parable
in Matthew 18 by saying that God would take his forgiveness away from
one of his servants who did not forgive his fellow servant from his
heart. Jesus's disciples acknowledged that his teaching on forgiveness
was so demanding that they needed his help to obey it:

> He said to the disciples, "It is impossible that no occasions of
> stumbling should come, but woe to him through whom they come! It would
> be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he
> were thrown into the sea, rather than that he should cause one of
> these little ones to stumble. Be careful. If your brother sins against
> you, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him. If he sins against you
> seven times in the day, and seven times returns, saying, 'I repent,'
> you shall forgive him." The apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our
> faith." (Luke 17:1-5)

People who think that they can make a serious attempt to faithfully obey
this radical teaching, that Jesus's disciples knew they did not have the
faith to obey, and at the same time just act like the people of this
world and put away their spouses with no intention of reconciliation are
seriously and dangerously deceived. Many people who have done that are
going to find out on judgment day that what Jesus said would be done to
the unforgiving servant is going to be done to them, to their eternal
condemnation.

Jesus taught in the Sermon on the Mount:

> "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and
> hate your enemy.' But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who
> curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who
> mistreat you and persecute you, that you may be children of your
> Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and
> the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust. For if you love
> those who love you, what reward do you have? Don't even the tax
> collectors do the same? If you only greet your friends, what more do
> you do than others? Don't even the tax collectors do the same?
> Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is
> perfect." (Matthew 5:43-48)

This radical pattern that Jesus both taught and modelled of showing love
and kindness to those who wrong us is one of the most beautiful and
costly parts of Jesus's teaching and example. Jesus's shows us what he
means by this by showing such love and mercy to us while we were still
his enemies. It is for that reason that that so many people praise
Jesus. Sadly among those who praise him for this, not many want to
imitate him for it. If you never had any recorded teaching from Jesus on
divorce and remarriage, you could still know how to respond to a spouse
who sinned against you or was unfaithful to you. You could know this
because Jesus's teaching on how we should love those who wrong us should
leave no doubt in our mind that your faithfulness to your spouse should
not be conditional on them showing consistent love to you. If you are
married, when you married your spouse you committed to be faithful to
your spouse until death. If you should show kindness and seek to bless a
stranger who might seek to torture or kill you (as happened to Jesus and
many of his early disciples), there should be no doubt what you should
do to the person you committed your life to when they sin against you,
no matter how grievous that sin might be or how long it might persist.

The third reason to reject the above interpretation of Matthew 19:9 is
that Paul's use of marriage as a picture of spiritual reality in Romans
7 would make no sense if marriage could be ended for adultery. In Romans
7 Paul made the following argument:

> Or don't you know, brothers (for I speak to men who know the law),
> that the law has dominion over a man for as long as he lives? For the
> woman that has a husband is bound by law to the husband while he
> lives, but if the husband dies, she is discharged from the law of the
> husband. So then if, while the husband lives, she is joined to another
> man, she would be called an adulteress. But if the husband dies, she
> is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she is
> joined to another man. Therefore, my brothers, you also were made dead
> to the law through the body of Christ, that you would be joined to
> another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might produce
> fruit to God. For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which
> were through the law worked in our members to bring out fruit to
> death. But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to
> that in which we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit,
> and not in oldness of the letter. (Romans 7:1-6)

If it were the case that anytime a husband or wife committed adultery
that their spouse was free to remarry without being called an adulteress
then Paul's analogy is a very bad one. His point here is that just as a
death is required for a women to be freed from her husband and marry
again, so the Romans that Paul was writing to could not be released from
the law and joined to Christ without a death. But if all that is
required to be released from a marriage is an act of adultery, then why
couldn't we be joined to Christ without a death having taken place? But
if an act of adultery can free someone from a marriage but not from the
law then this analogy would be a very careless one at best.

The fourth reason to reject this interpretation of Matthew 19:9 is the
response of Jesus's disciples to his teaching. After Jesus finished his
teaching on divorce and remarriage in Matthew 19:9, his disciples said,
"If this is the case of the man with his wife, it is not expedient to
marry." If what Jesus taught was that a husband was free to divorce and
remarry if his wife committed adultery then what the disciples said
meant that they thought it was better not to marry if the only reason
they could divorce and remarry was because of adultery. These were men
who had already left much of their lives behind to follow Jesus. It is
hard to imagine that they would only want to get married if they could
divorce and remarry for any of a number of reasons.

The fifth reason to reject this interpretation is the response of early
Christianity to Jesus's teaching. A complete review of what can be known
about the early Christian understanding of divorce and remarriage would
make this article too large. However, it can be clearly seen in a number
of ways that the early Christians did not understand Jesus to be
allowing remarriage in the case of adultery. One testimony to this is
the fact that no surviving copy of Mark 10, which is a parallel passage
to Matthew 19 contains any sort of exception. If the early Christians
had understood that Matthew 19 was allowing remarriage in the case of
adultery and if that understanding persisted more than a generation or
two, it is highly unlikely that scribes would not have added that into
Mark's account to harmonize it with Matthew. After all, it would be a
very major difference between the two and it would be understandable for
a scribe to not want to leave Mark as it was to mislead people if the
parallel passage in Matthew contained such a critical difference. Even
if the majority of manuscripts of Mark were copied unchanged, it is hard
to believe that at least one surviving manuscript would not have been
changed in that way. There are many harmonizations between parallel
passages in various manuscripts of Mathew, Mark and Luke where things of
much less consequence were harmonized by a scribe.

The first mention of divorce and remarriage in the early Christian
writings outside the New Testament is in *The Shepherd of Hermas*. This
writing from the late first or early second century claims to be a
record of a series of visions that Hermas of Rome had where he
interacted with a heavenly messenger sent to discuss and encourage
repentance. *The Shepherd of Hermas* is one of the most useful early
Christian writings for understanding early Christianity because it was
used more by early Christians of the first few centuries than perhaps
any other book outside the New Testament. Some early Christian writers
seem to have considered *The Shepherd of Hermas* authoritative. The
relevant section on divorce and remarriage is here:

> **29**.1. "I command you," he said, "to guard chastity, and do not let
> anything occur in your heart about another man's wife or about some
> immorality or about any such evil things even similar to these. For if
> you do this, you commit a great sin. But if you always keep your mind
> on your own wife, you will never go wrong. 2. For if this desire
> arises up in your heart, you will sin, and if other things just as
> evil rise up, you commit sin. For to a servant of God this desire is a
> great sin, and if anyone commits this evil act, he brings death upon
> himself. 3. So watch out; refrain from this desire; for where
> reverence dwells, there iniquity ought not to rise up in the heart of
> a righteous man." 4. I said to him, "Sir, let me ask you a few
> questions." "Speak up," he said. "Sir," I said, "if a man has a wife
> who is faithful in the Lord and he discovers her in some adultery,
> does the man then sin if he continues to live with her?" 5. "As long
> as he knows nothing of it," said he, "he does not sin, but if the
> husband knows of her sin and the wife does not repent, but persists in
> her evil, and the husband continues to live with her, he becomes
> guilty of her sin and a partner in her adultery." 6. "What then, sir,"
> I said, "should the husband do if the wife persists in this passion?"
> "Let him divorce her," he said, "and let the husband live by himself;
> but if when he has divorced her he marries another woman, he also
> commits adultery". 7. "So, sir," said I, "after the woman has been
> divorced, if she repents and wishes to be returned to her own husband,
> will she not be taken back?" 8. "Yes indeed," he said, "if the husband
> does not take her back, he sins and brings upon himself a great sin.
> At least it is necessary to take back the one who has sinned and
> repented, but not often, for there is one repentance for the servants
> of God. So in case of repentance, the husband ought not to marry. This
> course of action is valid for both wife and husband. 9. Not only,"
> said he, "is it adultery if anyone defiles his flesh, but also whoever
> does anything similar to what the heathen do commits adultery. So if
> anyone persists in such deeds and does not repent, avoid him and do
> not live with him, lest you also share in his sin. 10. That is why I
> order you to live by yourselves, whether husband or wife. For in such
> cases repentance is possible. 11. So I," said he, "am not giving a
> pretext for this matter to end in this way, but in order that the one
> who has sinned will sin no longer. Concerning his former sin there is
> one who is able to heal, for it is he who has power over all
> things."[^7]

Because *The Shepherd of Hermas* was so widely used and appreciated by
the early Christians, it is unlikely that it varies from common early
Christian belief on any major point. Therefore it is highly unlikely
that the early Christians would have accepted remarriage after adultery
and still placed such a high value on a writing that so clearly
condemned such a practice. Since *The Shepherd of Hermas* has not been
as carefully preserved as the books in the New Testament, it could be
argued that the current text we have could have been altered at some
point in its transmission. However, the basic idea that remarriage is
not allowed after adultery is so clearly stated in the preserved text of
*The Shepherd of Hermas* that it seems unlikely that the original text
of *The Shepherd of Hermas* would have communicated exactly the
opposite. As well, the text above is preserved at the end of the New
Testament in the Codex Siniaticus, which is thought to be both the
second oldest surviving Bible and also the oldest copy of Matthew 19:9
which does not read like Matthew 5:32. This means that if the text was
significantly altered after originally being written it would have had
to have been before Codex Siniaticus was written in the fourth century.
The fact that some people in the fourth century had no problem binding
this reading of Matthew 19:9 together with *The Shepherd of Hermas*
strongly suggests that they did not understand the "not for sexual
immorality" clause in Matthew 19:9 to be permitting remarriage in the
case of adultery.

Justin the Martyr, in his defence of Christianity written to the Roman
Emperor in the middle of the second century, summarized the Christian
teaching on remarriage like this: "those who make second marriages
according to human law are sinners in the sight of our Teacher."[^8]
Some of the early Christian writers seem to have explicitly opposed
second marriage after the death of a spouse, a practice which Paul, in 1
Corinthians 7, explicitly says is allowed. Whether Justin has these
types of second marriages in mind isn't clear from his quote but he
certainly must be including remarriage after divorce because he is
offering this summary as an explanation of some things that Justin had
quoted from Jesus's teaching including that, "Whoever marries a woman
who has been put away from another man commits adultery."

Now that we have examined some of the many reasons to reject the
interpretation of Matthew 19:9 that says that remarriage is allowed
after adultery, let us examine a few other interpretations of this
passage. Leslie McFall, who wrote extensively on this topic, proposed
two possible interpretations of this passage as it stands. First, he
proposed that when Jesus said "not for sexual immorality" he was meaning
that in the sense of "not even for sexual immorality." For example, we
might say to a child, "You may not leave the door open, not for
convenience, not for cooling down the house, not for any other reason."
If that were the case then Jesus would be clarifying for the Pharisees
that not only could a man not put away his wife for any cause but even
if he put her away for adultery, he was not free to remarry. This
interpretation has the advantage of harmonizing well with the rest of
the passages in the New Testament that discuss this topic as well as
Jesus's other teachings such as what he taught on forgiveness. A problem
with this interpretation is that the Pharisees who were testing Jesus
may not have been considering divorce and remarriage in the case of
adultery as they would presumably have generally stoned adulterous wives
and not divorced them. Given that possibility, Leslie McFall proposed a
second interpretation of this passage, that Jesus was using "not for
sexual immorality" as an indicator that he was referring to every other
reason for divorce, not because remarriage was allowed in the case of
divorce for adultery but because under the law of Moses, adultery never
resulted in divorce. This interpretation also has the advantage of
harmonizing well with the other passages we have looked at previously.
However, a potential problem with this interpretation is that Jesus was
not promoting the law of Moses and assuming the story at the beginning
of John 8 is authentic[^9], Jesus explicitly discouraged the killing of
an adulterous woman. Even if that story was not authentic, Jesus's
general teaching clearly prohibits killing people at all. Because of
that Jesus's teaching would need to somehow cover the case of what to do
with adultery. If you want to examine Leslie's understanding of Matthew
19:9 further, you can read his free book here:

Another interpretation of Matthew 19:9 is that the phrase "not for
sexual immorality" is referring to sexual immorality that happens during
the betrothal period, after a woman and man commit to marry but before
the actual marriage. The rational often given for this interpretation is
that we see in the New Testament that Joseph put Mary away when he
assumed that she had been involved in sexual immorality. This argument
rests on the idea that Matthew was written primarily to a Jewish
audience (an idea that has some early Christian support) and that the
Jews had certain betrothal customs that this passage is speaking to.
This would explain the difference between Matthew and Mark/Luke without
making Mark and Luke fundamentally misleading but it has some problems.
There is nothing in the passage that identifies anything to do with
betrothal. How would a Jewish person reading Matthew's account of
Jesus's teaching know that it was only acceptable to put away a woman
during the betrothal period and not after their marriage? Possible that
could be inferred from Matthew 5, but it makes for a somewhat
non-obvious interpretation. Another problem with this interpretation is
that it is based on the assumption that Gentile societies did not have
similar betrothal customs, which is a hard case to make looking that far
back in time.

Another interpretation of Matthew 19:9 is that Jesus is allowing for
separation or divorce in the case of sexual immorality committed by the
wife but not allowing remarriage. The rational often given for this
interpretation is that as the phrase "not for sexual immorality" occurs
in the middle of the sentence, that it is intended to apply only to the
first half of the sentence (that talks about separation) and not the
second half of the sentence (the remarriage part). This interpretation
has some serious problems. It is not only not obvious from reading
Matthew 19:9, but it seems a very unnatural reading of the grammar of
that sentence. It also presents a possible problem with harmonizing Mark
and Matthew. In both Mark 10 and Matthew 19, Jesus says that man should
not separate what God has joined together. If Jesus was teaching that
man could separate what God has joined together in the case of sexual
immorality in the wife then this potentially makes Mark's summary of
Jesus's teaching misleading. It could be said that the separation that
Jesus is prohibiting is the permanent separation that would allow for
remarriage, and in that case the two could be harmonized. However, this
would not be obvious from Mark 10. One thing in favour of this
interpretation is that it seems to align well with the teaching on
separation and remarriage in *The Shepherd of Hermas*, which instructs a
man to temporarily separate from an adulterous wife who will not repent
but forbids his remarriage and commands his reconciliation if his wife
would repent.

Another interpretation of Matthew 19:9 is that "not for sexual
immorality" is not referring to an act of adultery but to the nature of
the relationship between the man and woman being discussed. In other
words, if a man puts away a legitimate wife and marries another then he
commits adultery. However, if he puts away a women he is in a sexually
immoral relationship with, then what Jesus says does not apply since he
does not commit adultery if he marries another women if he had
previously been in an immoral relationship that God did not consider
marriage. This interpretation is reflected in the translation of Matthew
19:9 in a popular Roman Catholic translation of the New Testament, which
reads, "I say to you, whoever divorces his wife (unless the marriage is
unlawful) and marries another commits adultery."[^10] What this would
mean is that when Jesus uses the phrase "your woman", which generally
would be understood to mean wife, he is clarifying "not for (or based
on) sexual immorality" to ensure we understand he is only referring to a
woman that God considers a wife and not anyone that is considered a wife
by human standards. This interpretation harmonizes well with Mark and
Luke's summary of Jesus's teachings. Rather than stating a major
exception that would render Mark and Luke's summary misleading, it is
offering a clarification: that the Greek word "woman" only applies to a
legitimate wife in this context and not to any woman a man might be in a
"marriage-like" relationship with.

## Why did Jesus prohibit remarriage?

It is worth pointing out that Jesus's teachings in general heavily
emphasize doing what is most loving and they do not at all emphasize
getting what is fair. This is a reality worth spending some considerable
time meditating on. If you are focused on getting what is fair, Jesus's
teachings are going to seem strange and impractical to you. It goes
without saying that Jesus did not receive what was fair. Obviously, he
did nothing to deserve torture and death and it isn't fair that our sins
would necessitate that. However, it seems to not be obvious to many
people the ways in which Jesus's teachings are instructing us to accept
what isn't fair. If someone strikes you in the face, it is only fair
that they would be punished in return. However, Jesus teaches another
way, which is the turn the other cheek. If that way seems unreasonable
to you, then you need to spend some time considering what you should get
from God if you only want to receive what is fair. Another thing to
consider is how unreasonable it would be if you want to receive a
merciful judgment from the God you have directly and inexcusably wronged
while others who have wronged you get what they deserve.

It is in that context that we should consider the beauty of Jesus's
teaching on marriage. It is certainly true that adultery is a serious
violation of God's intention for marriage. It seems, based on how this
sin was treated under the Old Covenant law, that a person who does that
deserves to be thrown away, never to be received back. However, that is
not the most loving way to treat such a person. When Jesus was faced
with the challenge of what to do with a guilty adulteress, he showed
mercy and gave her another chance to go and sin no more. He also
instructed the people who were there wantingto kill her to let the
person without sin start the killing process. We would do just as well
to tell the person without sin to start the divorcing process. Only a
blind fool can not see their own guilt and need for mercy and only a
very reckless fool will want to arrive at the final judgment with a
clear pattern of demanding justice for those who deserve it.

Another things that Jesus's teaching strongly emphasizes is honesty and
humble commitment to our word. He so strongly values that that even
truthful oath-swearing is prohibited in his new law. Rather our yes,
should mean yes and our no, no. He says that anything more than that
comes from the evil one. If you have married and committed to a
life-long relationship of faithfulness, with death being the only end to
that, how can it be letting your yes be yes to break off that
relationship over the sin of your spouse? Would any reasonable and
objective person who listened to your marriage vows have reason to think
that you thought you would be free to put your spouse away and marry
someone else if they proved not to be faithful? When I was married, I
did not yet have a good understanding of this topic of divorce and
remarriage. I had been brought up with the idea that the New Testament
allowed divorce and remarriage in some cases. However, when I got
married, I had no question that the words I spoke to my wife completely
excluded the possibility of ending that relationship, no matter what
happened.

Most people whose consciences are not too seared to recognize this can
see that there is something really beautiful in Jesus's teachings.
Commands like "love your neighbour as yourself" and "do to others what
you would want them to do to you" are as inspirational and beautiful as
they are easy to understand. However, because they are very costly
principles, people generally only appreciate them in an abstract sense.
When it comes to really suffering for them, most people are not
interested. It is precisely in the sorts of trials like those that lead
to marriage breakdown that we get to see how much we are really
committed to these principles of love. As Jesus said:

> "If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even
> sinners love those who love them. If you do good to those who do good
> to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. If
> you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that
> to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive back as much. But
> love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing back; and
> your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High;
> for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil.
>
> "Therefore be merciful, even as your Father is also merciful. Don't
> judge, and you won't be judged. Don't condemn, and you won't be
> condemned. Set free, and you will be set free.
>
> "Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed down, shaken
> together, and running over, will be given to you. For with the same
> measure you measure it will be measured back to you."\
> (Luke 6:32-38)

If that teaching does not both fill you with awe and with fear as you
contemplate it, then you are missing something very fundamental in
Jesus's teaching.

[^2]: Papyrus 25, possibly from the third century or early fourth
    century

[^3]: Papyrus 25 contains a defect that is missing the first part of
    Matthew 19:9 and the surviving portion of Matthew 19:9 reads like
    the end of Matthew 5:32 but with a small variant

[^4]: Codex Sinaiticus, also dated to the the fourth century

[^5]: Even if adultery did not occur before the marriage break-down, the
    first person to be with someone else would be committing adultery
    and therefore the other spouse could potentially claim this as a
    justification for remarriage.

[^6]: If you really want to read Jesus's teachings like a lawyer, you
    could argue that Matthew 19:9 allows only a husband to remarry if
    his wife commits adultery and never allows a wife to remarry and
    that what Paul records in 1 Corinthians 7:10-11 only prohibits a
    wife from remarrying and therefore these two passages would not be
    incompatible. However, that very gender specific interpretation does
    not seem like a very likely interpretation of these passages and it
    doesn't resolve the other conflicts with Mark, Luke and Matthew 5.
