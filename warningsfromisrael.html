<h1 class="title">Warnings for Christians From What Happened to the People of Israel</h1>
</header>
<p>There are three passages in the New Testament that use the example of what happened after God saved the people of Israel from Egypt as a warning to disciples of Jesus of what might happen to them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea; and all ate the same spiritual food; and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ. However with most of them, God was not well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness. Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted. Don’t be idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.” Let’s not commit sexual immorality, as some of them committed, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell. Let’s not test Christ, as some of them tested, and perished by the serpents. Don’t grumble, as some of them also grumbled, and perished by the destroyer. Now all these things happened to them by way of example, and they were written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the ages have come. Therefore let him who thinks he stands be careful that he doesn’t fall. (I Corinthians 10:1-12)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken, but Christ is faithful as a Son over his house. We are his house, if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end. Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, “Today if you will hear his voice, don’t harden your hearts as in the rebellion, in the day of the trial in the wilderness, where your fathers tested me and tried me, and saw my deeds for forty years. Therefore I was displeased with that generation, and said, ‘They always err in their heart, but they didn’t know my ways.’ As I swore in my wrath, ‘They will not enter into my rest.’” Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there might be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God; but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called “today”, lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence firm to the end, while it is said, “Today if you will hear his voice, don’t harden your hearts, as in the rebellion.” For who, when they heard, rebelled? Wasn’t it all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses? With whom was he displeased forty years? Wasn’t it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? To whom did he swear that they wouldn’t enter into his rest, but to those who were disobedient? We see that they weren’t able to enter in because of unbelief. Let’s fear therefore, lest perhaps anyone of you should seem to have come short of a promise of entering into his rest. For indeed we have had good news preached to us, even as they also did, but the word they heard didn’t profit them, because it wasn’t mixed with faith by those who heard. For we who have believed do enter into that rest, even as he has said, “As I swore in my wrath, they will not enter into my rest;” although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. For he has said this somewhere about the seventh day, “God rested on the seventh day from all his works;” and in this place again, “They will not enter into my rest.” Seeing therefore it remains that some should enter into it, and they to whom the good news was preached before failed to enter in because of disobedience, he again defines a certain day, “today”, saying through David so long a time afterward (just as has been said), “Today if you will hear his voice, don’t harden your hearts.” For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day. There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God. For he who has entered into his rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from his. Let’s therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience. For the word of God is living and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart. There is no creature that is hidden from his sight, but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him to whom we must give an account. (Hebrews 3:5-4:13)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now I desire to remind you, though you already know this, that the Lord, having saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who didn’t believe. (Jude 1:5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is the point of these three warnings? In order to consider that, let us look at the similarities between the story of the people of Israel and salvation in the New Covenant.</p>

<p>If you doubt the parallels made in the above table, I encourage you to go back to the passages above and read them again.</p>
<p>Many people think of salvation as a single event. However, that is an oversimplification of salvation. The salvation of the people of Israel consisted of an initial event (or really a series of events) that delivered the people of Israel from Egypt, followed by a final act of salvation when they were brought out of the desert and into the promised land. In the same way, salvation in the New Covenant consists of an initial event of being saved from sin and a final event of being welcomed into God’s eternal Kingdom on judgment day.</p>
<p>Many people think of that salvation must either be earned (which they call “salvation by works”) or it must be unconditional (or nearly unconditional and not requiring ongoing obedience or submission to God). This is also an oversimplification. The people of Israel did not earn their salvation from Egypt. It was given to them by the mercy of God. They were required to take some steps in faithful obedience. Those steps included leaving the only home they had ever known, along with all the possessions they could not carry with them, and following Moses out into the desert. They also had to take the step of faith of walking through the Red Sea and trusting God’s deliverance there. However, obviously they knew that their simple acts of trust and obedience had not earned them their salvation from Egypt. On the other side of the Red Sea as they watched Pharaoh and his army drown, they did not congratulate themselves on saving themselves from Egypt. Instead they rightly praised God, seeing that he had done this for them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, rather than seeing what God had done to the Egyptians to save them and growing in the fear of God, many of the Israelites became overconfident in their salvation and did not remain faithful to God and do what he told them to do. As a result almost all of them failed to obtain the end goal of their salvation from Egypt. Some of them died very suddenly under the judgment of God (at one point 23,000 died in one day) but most of them were just left to wander in the wilderness until they grew old and died and never were allowed to cross into the promised land.</p>
<p>If it was the case that Christians after being set free from sin were guaranteed entry into God’s eternal kingdom on judgment day, regardless of how faithfully or obediently they had lived, then the warnings from scripture above would be silly and even misleading. If Christians are to take warning from what happened to the Israelites after they were saved from Egypt, then what could that warning be other than that they too may fail to enter into God’s final rest? In case it isn’t clear from the other warnings, the passage from Hebrews does spell out specifically that those Christians to whom the letter was written should be diligent to make sure they enter into that final rest and not fall from that due to disobedience. If it was the case that the only warning that we were to take from these passages was that we might die physically but still be able to enter into the promised rest with God, then why would that be a serious warning? Wouldn’t it be an advantage to leave this life early if we still were able to enter God’s eternal Kingdom in the end? Paul said that to die was a gain for him so why would God warn us so strongly of something that would be to our benefit?</p>
<p>The story of the people of Israel is a beautiful picture of salvation in the New Covenant. It shows us how God has been planning what he established through Jesus for a long time before it happened. The story of the people of Israel also serves as a valuable warning to us that being saved by the kindness of God is not an unconditional guarantee of entering into God’s eternal kingdom.</p>
