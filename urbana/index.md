# Urbana 2022

## "Who are those weird, crazy guys with signs outside of Urbana?"

We are a group of Christians who come from different backgrounds. Some of us are ex-Ammish, others ex-Mennonite, others ex-Evangelical. We are concerned because of the ways Christianity has been diluted and derailed over the course of time. What many professing Christians experience today is a terribly compromised form of Christianity that will not generally make us into the kind of disciples Jesus wants us to be. Many professing believers know deep down that something is very wrong. They know very well that most who claim to be Christians are not following Jesus with the kind of devotion that he called us to. It doesn't take a scholar to see that. We are looking for people who are open to something more, who want to pick up their own cross and lose their lives for Jesus. We do not represent a particular sect or denomination and come from various locations. We have our differences but all agree that following Jesus involves taking all of his teachings seriously, including his more radical commands. If you would like to talk more, please come and talk to one of us or email Tommy at tommyalbinholmes@gmail.com or Joel at joel@xpian.org.

To clear up any misunderstanding, our purpose here is to have peaceful conversations with individuals, not to protest Urbana or Intervarsity Christian Fellowship. However, we all do share concerns about this event and IVCF as an organization. To read some thoughts on this by Tommy, who was previously on IVCF staff, you can read the following:

[Is the mission of InterVarsity the same as the mission of Jesus?](mission_of_jesus_vs_mission_of_intervarsity.html)

There may be other individuals and groups outside Urbana this year talking to people. We want to be clear that if you see people outside Urbana, being angry, promoting violence or hatred, or promoting political solutions to the world's problems, that isn't us. Our heart it to see the radical love and self-sacrifice that Jesus taught grow in our lives and yours. We want to see people's hearts changed by the love of Christ and the fear of God, not by compulsion, violence and politics.
