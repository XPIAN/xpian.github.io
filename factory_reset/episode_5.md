# Factory Reset Episode 5: Law of Messiah --- Are you ready for some football?

This episode covers the first of four dangerous ideas that contribute to a casual response to Jesus and what he commanded. If we have the wrong gospel, we're not going to get the right results. 

May God help us to recover the true heart of the gospel and the implications for our lives. When we do, we'll begin to understand why the early believers had such a radical response to Jesus.
