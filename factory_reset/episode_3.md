# Factory Reset Episode 3: Salvation part 2 - The "Jesus Glasses"

Protestant evangelicals generally read the New Testament through the lens of Luther and Calvin. That lens comes with certain theological assumptions and commitments. What happens if we try to put that lens aside and read it through the lens Jesus provides - the Jesus Glasses?

If we read it that way, we'll begin to understand why the apostles and their disciples were generally so much more serious about all of this than we tend to be.

Please listen with an open mind.
