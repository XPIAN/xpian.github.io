# Factory Reset podcast

By Thomas Holmes

When a cell phone has too many apps, it becomes inefficient. If you want it to run well again, you may consider giving it a "factory reset."

Christianity has generally evolved into something irreconcilable with the movement Jesus ignited. We learn doctrines and ways of thinking and living that would've seemed strange and dangerous to the early church. And so we don't become the kind of disciples Jesus produced. Let's do a "factory reset."

Let's recover the message that went out from Jerusalem in the first century.
